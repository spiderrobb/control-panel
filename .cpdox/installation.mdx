# Installing the Extension

This guide covers how to install and run the ControlPanel extension in your local VS Code environment.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- VS Code (v1.85.0 or higher)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install all required npm packages:

```bash
npm install
```

<TaskLink label="npm: install" />

### 2. Compile the Extension

Compile the extension in development mode:

```bash
npm run compile
```

<TaskLink label="compile" />

### 3. Package the Extension

Create a `.vsix` file that can be installed in VS Code:

```bash
npm run package
```

<TaskLink label="package" />

This will generate a file named `controlpanel-0.0.1.vsix` (or similar, based on your version) in the project root.

### 4. Install the Extension in VS Code

Install the packaged extension using the VS Code CLI:

```bash
code --install-extension controlpanel-0.0.1.vsix
```

<TaskLink label="install-extension" />

Alternatively, you can:
- Open VS Code
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
- Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
- Select the `.vsix` file from your project directory

### 5. Reload VS Code

After installation, reload VS Code to activate the extension:

```bash
code --reload
```

Or press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and select "Developer: Reload Window"

## Development Mode

For development and testing, you don't need to package and install the extension. Instead:

1. Open the project in VS Code
2. Press `F5` to launch the Extension Development Host
3. This opens a new VS Code window with your extension loaded
4. Make changes and press `Ctrl+R` in the Extension Development Host to reload

### Watch Mode

To automatically recompile when you make changes:

```bash
npm run watch
```

<TaskLink label="watch" />

## Updating the Extension

When you make changes and want to update the installed extension:

1. Compile the changes: `npm run compile`
2. Package the extension: `npm run package`
3. Uninstall the old version (optional): `code --uninstall-extension your-publisher-name.controlpanel`
4. Install the new version: `code --install-extension controlpanel-0.0.1.vsix`
5. Reload VS Code

<TaskLink label="reinstall-extension" />

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Appearing

- Ensure you've reloaded VS Code after installation
- Check the Extensions view to verify installation
- Look for errors in the Developer Console (`Help > Toggle Developer Tools`)

### Build Errors

- Run `npm run lint` to check for code issues
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Clear the `dist` folder and rebuild

### Package Errors

- Ensure `@vscode/vsce` is installed: `npm install -g @vscode/vsce`
- Check that `package.json` has all required fields
