## Introduction

Anchor links allow you to create **internal navigation** within your documentation. Instead of scrolling manually to find a section, users can click a link and jump directly to the content they need.

This is especially useful for:
- Long documentation pages
- Quick reference guides
- Tutorial navigation
- API documentation

Jump back to the [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents) at any time!

## Features

The anchor link system in ControlPanel provides:

1. **Automatic ID Generation** - Every heading gets a unique ID automatically
2. **Smooth Scrolling** - Clicking a link smoothly scrolls to the target
3. **Proper Positioning** - Headings are positioned with appropriate margins
4. **Standard Markdown** - Uses familiar `[text](#anchor)` syntax

Want to see more examples? Check out [Examples](#examples) below!

## How to Use

### Step 1: Write Your Headings

Simply write your headings as you normally would:

```markdown
## My Section Title
```

### Step 2: Create Links

Reference the heading using a hash (`#`) and the slugified title:

```markdown
[My Section Title](#my-section-title)
```

### Step 3: Test It Out

Click the link to verify it scrolls to the correct section!

For more details, see the [Best Practices](#best-practices) section.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Navigation

Here's a simple example of jumping between sections:

- From Features: [Go to Introduction](#introduction)
- Back again: [Return to Examples](#examples)

### Example 2: Documentation Structure

You might structure documentation like this:

```markdown
# API Reference

## Quick Links
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [Endpoints](#endpoints)
- [Error Handling](#error-handling)

## Authentication
...

## Endpoints
...

## Error Handling
...
```

## Best Practices

When creating anchor links, follow these guidelines:

### ✅ Do's

1. **Use descriptive headings** - Clear headings create clear anchors
2. **Keep headings unique** - Avoid duplicate heading text in the same document
3. **Test your links** - Click each link to verify it works
4. **Use a table of contents** - Help users navigate long documents

### ❌ Don'ts

1. **Avoid special characters in headings** - Keep it simple with letters and numbers
2. **Don't use duplicate headings** - Each heading should be unique
3. **Don't forget the hash** - Links must start with `#`
4. **Don't break the naming convention** - Follow the slug generation rules
