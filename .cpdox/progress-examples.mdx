# Visual Progress Examples

This page demonstrates the different progress states for running tasks.

## Progress States

### First Run - Animated Stripes
When you run a task for the first time, you'll see diagonal stripes animating across the background at 17% opacity. This indicates the task is running but we don't have historical data yet.

Try it: <TaskLink label="build:extension" />

### Subsequent Runs - Progress Bar
After the first run, the extension remembers how long the task took. On subsequent runs, you'll see a blue progress bar that fills from left to right based on the 10-run rolling average.

Try it: <TaskLink label="build:webview" />

### Long Running Tasks - Solid Blue
For tasks that run longer than 60 seconds, the progress indicator switches to a solid blue background to indicate steady-state execution.

Try it: <TaskLink label="test:integration" />

## Subtask Visualization

When a task spawns subtasks, the task pill expands vertically to show the hierarchy:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🟢 build:all        1m 23s  ⚡ ■   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   ↳ build:extension                 │
│   ↳ build:webview                   │
│   ↳ test:unit                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Example: Complex Build

<TaskLink label="build:all" />

This task typically spawns multiple subtasks that you'll see listed below the main task when running.

## Running Tasks Panel

When any tasks are running, a panel appears at the bottom of the extension showing:

- All running tasks in one consolidated view
- Progress indicators for each task
- Subtask hierarchies
- Quick access buttons (⚡ focus, ■ stop)

The panel automatically shows/hides based on whether tasks are active.

## Task Lists

View all available tasks organized by prefix:

### Build Tasks
<TaskList labelStartsWith="build:" />

### Test Tasks
<TaskList labelStartsWith="test:" />

### Utility Tasks
<TaskList labelStartsWith="compile" />

## Tips

1. **Hover over task links** in idle state to see run button
2. **Click ⚡ lightning** to focus the task's terminal
3. **Click ■ square** to stop a running task
4. **Watch the progress bar** to estimate completion time
5. **Check the Running Tasks panel** for an overview of all active tasks

## Technical Details

The progress calculation uses a simple formula:

```
progress = (currentDuration / averageDuration) × 100
```

The extension stores the last 10 execution durations for each task to calculate the rolling average. This data persists across VS Code sessions using the extension's global state.

## Try It Out!

Run multiple tasks simultaneously to see how the Running Tasks panel manages them:

1. <TaskLink label="build:extension" />
2. <TaskLink label="build:webview" />
3. <TaskLink label="test:unit" />

All three tasks will appear in the Running Tasks panel at the bottom, each with its own progress indicator and controls.
