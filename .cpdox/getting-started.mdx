# Getting Started

Welcome to the **Control Panel** - your interactive documentation and task management hub!

## What is Control Panel?

Control Panel combines documentation with executable tasks, making it easy to:

- 📖 Browse documentation in MDX format
- ▶️ Run tasks directly from documentation
- 🔗 Navigate between related docs
- ⚡ Monitor running tasks in real-time

## Quick Start

Check out our example tasks below:

<TaskList labelStartsWith="build:" />

## Navigation

- [Task Progress Features](task-progress.mdx) - **NEW!** Smart progress tracking
- [Development Guide](development.mdx)
- [Deployment Guide](deployment.mdx)

## Example Task Link

Need to build the project? <TaskLink label="build:all" />

## How It Works

The Control Panel extension watches the `.cpdox` directory for MDX files. When you click on links in the documentation, the panel updates to show the new content.

### Interactive Task Components

- **TaskLink**: Click to run a single task with hover controls
- **TaskList**: Display and filter tasks by label prefix

### Task States

When you run a task, you'll see:
- 🟢 **Running** - Green indicator with runtime counter
- ⚡ **Focus** - Button to jump to the task's terminal
- ⏹️ **Stop** - Button to terminate the task

Try it out with any of the tasks listed above!
