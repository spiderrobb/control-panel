# Deployment Guide

Ready to deploy your application? This guide will help you through the process.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure everything is ready:

1. ✅ Run all tests: <TaskLink label="test:all" />
2. ✅ Build production bundle: <TaskLink label="build:production" />
3. ✅ Run security audit: <TaskLink label="security:audit" />
4. ✅ Update version: <TaskLink label="version:bump" />

## Deployment Tasks

## Environment-Specific Deployments

### Staging Environment

Perfect for testing before production:

- Deploy to staging: <TaskLink label="deploy:staging" />
- Run staging smoke tests: <TaskLink label="test:staging" />

### Production Environment

When you're ready to go live:

- Deploy to production: <TaskLink label="deploy:production" />
- Run production smoke tests: <TaskLink label="test:smoke" />

> **Warning**: Production deployments are irreversible. Always test in staging first!

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, monitor your application:

### Monitoring

- Check logs: <TaskLink label="logs:production" />
- View metrics: <TaskLink label="metrics:dashboard" />
- Check health: <TaskLink label="health:check" />

### Rollback

If something goes wrong:

- Rollback to previous version: <TaskLink label="deploy:rollback" />
